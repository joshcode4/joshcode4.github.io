Hi, I'm Josh Code. 

It's been said that our names determine our fate in life, and it's no coincidence that I was born to code. Since I was little, I've been told that my mind is equal parts engineer and artist. I love vintage maps and the Sunday crossword, yet I work for a Baroque music non-profit and substitute teach elementary school art class. I thrive in finding the beauty in the gritty, technical puzzles of data.
 
I'm deeply passionate about data-driven storytelling. For my undergraduate capstone I produced a data-driven urban history project about Bunker Hill, a Los Angeles neighborhood lost to urban development. By using Python to scrape demographic information from old census data, I was able to paint a picture of both the demographics of the neighorbood, as well as individual stories from Bunker Hill residents.

I've also used data to analyze ticket sales and audience demographics for my job as Philanthropy and Grants Associate for Musica Transalpina, a Baroque ensemble dedicated to the research and performance of rare early music. As a result of my insights, we have been able to program more Latin American Baroque pieces to appeal to Hispanic music fans and reach an audience previously underrepresented in the classical music space.

I'm a natural puzzle lover and an artist at heart, but my strongest talent is for using data to delivering historical and demographic insights. Feel free to browse my projects to see how I weave together data-driven analytics and human interest to tell stories with heart.
