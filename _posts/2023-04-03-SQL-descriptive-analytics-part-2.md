title: Using SQL to run descriptive analytics on census data, part 2
categories: [p]
---

Continuing my analysis of this Los Angeles census dataset, I used SQL to run queries about home ownership and rent prices. In exploring these parts of the data, my aim was to deploy descriptive analytics to track how various rent- and ownership-related metrics changed over time.

**How many men own vs. rent? How many women? What is the average home value and average rent in this census district?**
